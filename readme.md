# Development Environment

For the development of this software, I used the following tools:

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code, for its robust feature set and extensions that streamline the coding process.
Web Browser: Google Chrome, to test and debug the application.
Version Control: Git, for managing and tracking changes in the codebase.
The primary programming language used in this project is JavaScript, alongside HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the web application. JavaScript was chosen for its versatility and ability to create interactive web elements.
